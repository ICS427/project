Burns School of Medicine that unites individuals in medicine with talents in art and music.  Founded in 2015, JAM was created after noticing the struggle of finding student performers for JABSOM-related events such as the Senior Lu'au and Willed Body Ceremony. There was certainly no lack of talent, rather the lack of a network to recognize and bring together those with creative talents, which is easily forgotten in the midst of endless exams and long hours on the wards.  Thus, medical students Christina Wu, Caroline Ritson, and Leimomi Kanagusuku worked together to create a group that would help rekindle the passion for \"right-brain\" activities that are fun, therapeutic, and inspiring, but also bring together those with diverse talents and great potential to impact the community beyond the practice of medicine.",

The Rainbow Warrior Racing Team at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa was developed from the mechanical engineering undergraduate senior design course.

We have also opened the team to anyone who attends the university in hopes to expand our knowledge and perspectives contributing to our project. As a result, our team has become more diverse with over 30 students coming from different disciplines, ethnic groups, and ages.",

An internationally competitive debate program brings honor and esteem to the University of Hawai‘i, attracting the best and brightest students and encouraging the top talent from our Hawai‘i secondary schools to remain in the islands for higher education. Currently, we lose many articulate, future leaders to mainland schools with well-endowed debate programs. By offering an alternative close to home, we create a pipeline for talent. An intramural collegiate debate league exposes students to a diversity of ideas and improves discourse between institutions of higher learning within our state. Finally, our service dedicated to fostering the forensic development of Hawai‘i youth helps establish a clear path between organizations like the Hawai‘i Speech League and the University of Hawai‘i. By providing resources for development to youth, we empower them to be leaders and agents of change in their communities, and in so doing, we improve the governance of our state.",

This is a national collegiate honor society for students in their senior year.  Each chapter is typically comprised of only a handful of carefully selected applicants for the year - the Hui Po'okela Chapter usually does not exceed 25 members at a time. Potential members are chosen based on how they measure in accord with Mortar Board's key values: scholarship, leadership, and service. Those who excel in said values are then carefully examined through a series of interviews hosted by the chapter's current members. Once in Mortar Board, you will engage in various community service and fundraising activities.  It is a great opportunity to give back to the community and form close friendships with your fellow Mortar Board members.",

Many religions and philosophies exist to point us onto a path to find God, enlightenment, or the good life. As Christians we believe the opposite. God came to us—in Jesus Christ. We gather together to study the Bible so that we might not only know about Him, but know Him personally. We are here for the “convinced” and the “unconvinced,” the lost, the found, the burned, bored, cynical, and spiritual. None of us has it all together, but we are deeply committed to the gospel of Jesus, believing it has the power to change any person, any community, any culture.",
